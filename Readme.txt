with prototype pattern, you can specify the general class need in a program
but defer specifying the exact class until execution time. target classes are 
constructed by clonning one or more prototype classes and then changing and filling 
the cloned class as desired prototype pattern is mainly used when you need classes 
that differ in the type of prossessing they offer.

so when we look at the given problem we want the data of the swimmers tabulated then 
once we have this we want to sort the table based on diffrent criterias or example based 
on age, age_group, sex so the prototype pattern is the best pattern for this kind of problem
